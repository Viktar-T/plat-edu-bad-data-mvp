influxdb works. I can manualy create bucket and send data Fields(power, voltage, current, temperature, efficiency). for example I can send it via restful API.  But node-red does not send Fields(power, voltage, current, temperature, efficiency). 

I have restarted the container.

Welcome to Node-RED

===================

from Node-red GUT.

8/5/2025, 2:19:29 PM[node: Success Log](http://localhost:1880/#)devices/photovoltaic/pv_010/telemetry : msg.influxdb_status : undefined

*undefined*

======================

then I imported node-red\flows\v2.0-pv-mqtt-loop-simulation.json and deployed.

================

Lets check whether all files inside node-red folder are correct.
Check whether all dependents were installed correctly 

Check whether deployed flow.

Analyse build folder structure node-red\data. Is it correct that node-red\data\flows is empty.
