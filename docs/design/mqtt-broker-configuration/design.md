# MQTT Broker Configuration - Design

## Overview

A comprehensive Mosquitto MQTT broker configuration for the IoT Renewable Energy Monitoring System, providing secure, scalable messaging infrastructure with authentication, topic-based access control, persistence, and WebSocket support.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Authentication**: Username/password authentication for all devices and services
- **Topic Structure**: Hierarchical topic design for scalable device management
- **Access Control**: Topic-based permissions with Access Control List (ACL)
- **Persistence**: Message storage and recovery for system reliability
- **WebSocket Support**: Web application connectivity on port 9001
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging
- **Health Monitoring**: System health checks and status reporting

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: No anonymous access, strong password policies
- **Scalability**: Support for 1000+ concurrent connections
- **Performance**: Optimized message handling and queue management
- **Reliability**: Message persistence and autosave functionality
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and performance metrics
- **Maintainability**: Clear configuration structure and documentation

### Constraints
- **Docker-based deployment** for containerized architecture
- **Environment variable configuration** for flexible deployment
- **Backward compatibility** with existing MQTT clients
- **Resource limits** appropriate for IoT device communication

## Design Decisions

### 1. Mosquitto as MQTT Broker
**Decision**: Use Eclipse Mosquitto 2.0.18 as the MQTT broker
**Rationale**: 
- Industry standard with proven reliability
- Excellent Docker support and configuration flexibility
- Built-in authentication and ACL support
- Active community and documentation

### 2. Hierarchical Topic Structure
**Decision**: Implement `devices/{device_type}/{device_id}/{data_type}` topic pattern
**Rationale**:
- Scalable for multiple device types and instances
- Clear separation of concerns (data, status, commands)
- Easy to implement wildcard permissions
- Supports future device additions

### 3. Authentication Strategy
**Decision**: Username/password authentication with device-specific credentials
**Rationale**:
- Simple to implement and manage
- Provides adequate security for IoT environments
- Easy to rotate credentials per device
- Supports service account separation

### 4. Access Control Implementation
**Decision**: Use Mosquitto ACL file for topic-based permissions
**Rationale**:
- Granular control over topic access
- Device isolation for security
- Service-specific permissions
- Wildcard support for scalability

### 5. Persistence Configuration
**Decision**: Enable persistence with 30-minute autosave interval
**Rationale**:
- Ensures message reliability across restarts
- Balances performance with data safety
- Configurable for different deployment scenarios

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Configuration
1. **Mosquitto Configuration File** - Main broker settings
2. **Password File** - Device and service authentication
3. **ACL File** - Topic-based access control
4. **Docker Integration** - Container configuration

### Phase 2: Security Implementation
1. **Authentication Setup** - Password generation and management
2. **Access Control** - Topic permissions and device isolation
3. **Environment Variables** - Secure credential management
4. **SSL/TLS Preparation** - Certificate configuration (production)

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
1. **Connectivity Testing** - Basic broker functionality
2. **Authentication Testing** - Credential validation
3. **Topic Testing** - Publishing and subscribing
4. **Security Testing** - Access control validation

### Phase 4: Documentation and Setup
1. **Setup Scripts** - Automated configuration
2. **Testing Scripts** - Comprehensive validation
3. **Documentation** - Configuration guides and best practices
4. **Monitoring** - Health checks and logging

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Configuration Validation**: Syntax checking and parameter validation
- **Password Generation**: Secure credential creation
- **ACL Validation**: Permission structure verification

### Integration Testing
- **Docker Integration**: Container startup and health checks
- **Service Communication**: MQTT client connectivity
- **Topic Routing**: Message delivery and subscription

### Security Testing
- **Authentication**: Valid and invalid credential testing
- **Access Control**: Topic permission validation
- **Anonymous Access**: Verification of disabled anonymous connections

### Performance Testing
- **Connection Limits**: Maximum concurrent connections
- **Message Throughput**: Publishing and subscribing performance
- **Memory Usage**: Resource consumption monitoring

### End-to-End Testing
- **Device Simulation**: Complete data flow testing
- **Service Integration**: Node-RED and Grafana connectivity
- **Error Handling**: Failure scenarios and recovery
