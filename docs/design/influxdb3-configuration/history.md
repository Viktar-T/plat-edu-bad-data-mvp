# InfluxDB 3.x Configuration - History

## 2024-01-15 - Complete InfluxDB 3.x Configuration Session

**Context**: Comprehensive configuration of InfluxDB 3.x for renewable energy monitoring system, replacing InfluxDB 2.x bucket-based approach with database and table structure.

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Database Architecture Migration**
   - **Decision**: Migrate from InfluxDB 2.x buckets to InfluxDB 3.x databases and tables
   - **Reasoning**: Better organization, SQL query support, improved performance, unlimited cardinality
   - **Alternatives Considered**: 
     - Stay with InfluxDB 2.x (rejected - missing new features)
     - Use different time-series database (rejected - InfluxDB 3.x best fit)
   - **Impact**: Requires migration effort but provides significant benefits

2. **Schema Design Strategy**
   - **Decision**: Implement comprehensive tagging strategy with device_id, location, device_type as tags
   - **Reasoning**: Enables efficient querying, unlimited cardinality, optimized for renewable energy patterns
   - **Alternatives Considered**:
     - Use measurements like InfluxDB 2.x (rejected - less flexible)
     - Minimal tagging (rejected - poor query performance)
   - **Impact**: Optimized query performance and flexible data organization

3. **Energy Storage Schema Complexity**
   - **Decision**: Create detailed energy storage schema with 30+ fields including comprehensive battery analytics
   - **Reasoning**: University research requirements demand detailed battery monitoring and analysis capabilities
   - **Alternatives Considered**:
     - Basic schema with minimal fields (rejected - insufficient for research)
     - Separate tables for different battery aspects (rejected - complexity)
   - **Impact**: Supports advanced energy storage research and monitoring

4. **Token-Based Authentication**
   - **Decision**: Use new InfluxDB 3.x token system with granular permissions
   - **Reasoning**: Better security than username/password, application-specific access control
   - **Alternatives Considered**:
     - Username/password authentication (rejected - less secure)
     - Certificate-based auth (rejected - complexity for MVP)
   - **Impact**: Improved security model with fine-grained access control

5. **Object Storage Configuration**
   - **Decision**: Implement file-based storage for MVP, S3-compatible for production
   - **Reasoning**: Cost-effective long-term retention with Parquet format, scalable to production
   - **Alternatives Considered**:
     - Local storage only (rejected - no long-term retention)
     - S3 from start (rejected - complexity for MVP)
   - **Impact**: Cost-effective storage with production scalability

6. **Cross-Platform Setup Scripts**
   - **Decision**: Create both bash and PowerShell scripts for database initialization
   - **Reasoning**: Support both Linux/macOS and Windows development environments
   - **Alternatives Considered**:
     - Bash only (rejected - excludes Windows users)
     - Docker-only approach (rejected - less flexible)
   - **Impact**: Better developer experience across platforms
