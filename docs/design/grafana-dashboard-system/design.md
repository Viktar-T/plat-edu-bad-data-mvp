# Grafana Dashboard System - Design

## Overview
Comprehensive dashboard system for renewable energy IoT monitoring, providing real-time visualization of photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, biogas plants, heat boilers, and energy storage systems. The system integrates with InfluxDB 3.x and provides advanced analytics, alerting, and operational monitoring capabilities.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Real-time monitoring of 5 renewable energy device types
- System-wide overview dashboard with aggregated metrics
- Device-specific dashboards with detailed analytics
- Interactive filtering by device ID, location, and parameter ranges
- Auto-refresh capabilities (30-second intervals)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop access
- Alert threshold visualization with color-coded indicators
- Historical data analysis with time-series visualization
- Performance correlation analysis between different parameters

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Dashboard load time < 5 seconds
- Support for 30-second auto-refresh intervals
- Mobile-responsive design
- Dark theme for field monitoring
- UTC timezone support
- Integration with InfluxDB 3.x Flux queries
- Docker containerization compatibility

### Constraints and Limitations
- MVP scope focusing on core monitoring capabilities
- InfluxDB 3.x as the primary data source
- Grafana 10.x compatibility
- JSON-based dashboard provisioning
- Flux query language for data retrieval

## Design Decisions

### Technology Choices
- **Grafana 10.x**: Chosen for advanced visualization capabilities and InfluxDB 3.x support
- **InfluxDB 3.x**: Time-series database with Flux query language
- **JSON Dashboard Provisioning**: Automated deployment and version control
- **Flux Queries**: Native InfluxDB 3.x query language for optimal performance
- **Docker Containerization**: Consistent deployment across environments

### Architectural Decisions
- **Modular Dashboard Design**: Separate dashboards for each device type with system overview
- **Variable-Based Filtering**: Dynamic filtering using Grafana template variables
- **Dual-Axis Visualization**: Correlated parameter analysis on single panels
- **Threshold-Based Alerting**: Color-coded indicators for operational status
- **Responsive Grid Layout**: Adaptive panel arrangement for different screen sizes

### Dashboard Structure
- **System Overview**: Aggregated metrics across all device types
- **Device-Specific Dashboards**: Detailed monitoring for each renewable energy type
- **Standardized Panel Types**: Consistent use of Stat, Gauge, Time Series, Table, and Chart panels
- **Variable Integration**: Dynamic filtering and parameter selection
