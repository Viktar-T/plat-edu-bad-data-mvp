### Challenges and Solutions

#### Challenge 1: PowerShell Directory Creation
- **Issue**: `mkdir -p` syntax not supported in PowerShell
- **Solution**: Used `New-Item -ItemType Directory` with proper PowerShell syntax

#### Challenge 2: Environment File Creation
- **Issue**: `.env.example` blocked by global ignore
- **Solution**: Created `env.example` as alternative filename

#### Challenge 3: Script Permissions
- **Issue**: `chmod` not available in Windows PowerShell
- **Solution**: Noted that scripts would need to be made executable in Linux/WSL environment
