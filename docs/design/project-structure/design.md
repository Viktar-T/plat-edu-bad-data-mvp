# IoT Renewable Energy Monitoring System - Project Structure Design

## Overview
A comprehensive IoT-based real-time monitoring system for renewable energy sources including photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, biogas plants, heat boilers, and energy storage systems. The system follows a microservices architecture with data flow: MQTT → Node-RED → InfluxDB → Grafana.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Real-time data collection from multiple renewable energy device types
- Data processing and validation through Node-RED flows
- Time-series data storage in InfluxDB
- Real-time visualization and dashboards in Grafana
- Device simulation for testing and development
- Containerized deployment with Docker Compose

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Support for multiple devices and high data volumes
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and health checks
- **Security**: Authentication, encryption, and access controls
- **Performance**: Optimized data processing and storage
- **Maintainability**: Clear project structure and documentation
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript support for Node-RED flows

### Constraints and Limitations
- Docker-based deployment requirement
- MQTT as the primary communication protocol
- InfluxDB for time-series data storage
- Node-RED for data processing workflows
- Grafana for visualization

## Design Decisions

### Architecture Pattern
- **Microservices Architecture**: Each component (MQTT, Node-RED, InfluxDB, Grafana) runs as a separate container
- **Data Flow Pipeline**: Clear unidirectional flow from devices to visualization
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker Compose for local development and testing

### Technology Stack
- **MQTT Broker**: Eclipse Mosquitto (lightweight, widely supported)
- **Data Processing**: Node-RED with TypeScript support
- **Database**: InfluxDB 2.x (optimized for time-series data)
- **Visualization**: Grafana (rich dashboard capabilities)
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Language**: TypeScript/JavaScript for Node-RED flows

### Project Structure
- **Modular Organization**: Separate directories for each service
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and architecture docs
- **Scripts**: Automated setup and simulation tools

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Structure Setup
1. Create main directory structure
2. Initialize Docker Compose configuration
3. Set up environment variables template
4. Create comprehensive README.md

### Phase 2: Service Configuration
1. Configure MQTT broker (Mosquitto)
2. Set up Node-RED with TypeScript support
3. Initialize InfluxDB with proper schema
4. Configure Grafana dashboards

### Phase 3: Development Tools
1. Create startup and management scripts
2. Implement device simulation
3. Set up health checks and monitoring
4. Create development workflow documentation

### Phase 4: Documentation and Testing
1. Generate architecture documentation
2. Create development workflow guide
3. Implement error handling and validation
4. Set up testing procedures

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Node-RED function node testing
- MQTT message validation
- InfluxDB query optimization
- Grafana dashboard functionality

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end data flow testing
- Service communication validation
- Container health check verification
- Performance benchmarking

### Load Testing
- High-volume data simulation
- Multiple device testing
- System resource monitoring
- Scalability validation

## Success Criteria
- All services start successfully with Docker Compose
- Data flows correctly from MQTT through Node-RED to InfluxDB
- Grafana dashboards display real-time data
- Device simulation generates realistic data
- Comprehensive error handling prevents data loss
- TypeScript compilation works in Node-RED
- Health checks pass for all services
