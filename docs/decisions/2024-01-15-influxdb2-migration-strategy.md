# 2024-01-15 - InfluxDB 2.x Migration Strategy

## Status
**Accepted**

## Context
The user encountered significant issues with InfluxDB 3.x configuration and testing, including:
- Complex API endpoints and CLI tools
- Lack of GUI support
- Authentication and query language inconsistencies
- Difficulty for beginner-level programming

The system needed a more user-friendly, GUI-supported database solution that would work better for a beginner-level programmer while maintaining all functionality.

## Decision
Migrate from InfluxDB 3.x to InfluxDB 2.7 using a "Delete and Fresh Start" strategy with systematic prompt-based implementation.

### Key Components:
1. **InfluxDB 2.7**: Latest stable version with GUI support
2. **Flux Query Language**: Standardized across all components
3. **Token Authentication**: Static token for MVP simplicity
4. **PowerShell Testing Framework**: Windows-native testing approach
5. **Prompt-Based Implementation**: Systematic 7-phase migration process

## Consequences

### Positive
- **GUI Support**: InfluxDB 2.x provides web-based GUI for easier management
- **Beginner-Friendly**: More intuitive interface and documentation
- **Consistent Query Language**: Flux standardized across all components
- **Simplified Authentication**: Static token reduces complexity
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Robust testing framework for validation
- **Better Documentation**: Extensive documentation and community support
- **Stable Platform**: Mature, well-supported InfluxDB version

### Negative
- **Migration Effort**: Complete system reconfiguration required
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Flux query language
- **Temporary Disruption**: System downtime during migration
- **Configuration Complexity**: Need to recreate all configurations
- **Testing Overhead**: Comprehensive testing framework development

## Alternatives Considered

### Continue with InfluxDB 3.x
- **Why Rejected**: Too complex for beginner-level programming, lack of GUI support, ongoing configuration issues
- **Impact**: Would continue to cause frustration and slow development

### Step-by-Step Migration
- **Why Rejected**: Risk of configuration conflicts and partial system states
- **Impact**: Could lead to inconsistent system behavior

### Use Different Time-Series Database
- **Why Rejected**: Would require complete system redesign and lose InfluxDB ecosystem benefits
- **Impact**: Significant development overhead and loss of existing knowledge

### Minimal InfluxDB 2.x Migration
- **Why Rejected**: Would not address the fundamental usability issues
- **Impact**: Would not provide the desired GUI and beginner-friendly experience

## Implementation Notes

### Migration Strategy
1. **Delete and Fresh Start**: Complete removal of InfluxDB 3.x configuration
2. **Prompt-Based Implementation**: Systematic implementation using structured prompts
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full testing framework for validation
4. **Documentation Updates**: Complete documentation alignment

### Technical Specifications
- **Docker Image**: `influxdb:2.7`
- **Authentication**: Static token `renewable_energy_admin_token_123`
- **Organization**: `renewable_energy_org`
- **Bucket**: `renewable_energy`
- **Query Language**: Flux (standardized)
- **Testing Framework**: PowerShell + JavaScript

### Success Criteria
- All components successfully migrated to InfluxDB 2.x
- GUI accessible and functional
- All automated tests pass
- Manual test procedures work correctly
- Documentation accurately reflects current system state
