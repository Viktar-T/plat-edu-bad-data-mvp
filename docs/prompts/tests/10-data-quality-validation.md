# Data Quality Validation (Phase 4 - Validation)

## Objective
Implement data quality validation for the renewable energy IoT monitoring system MVP, focusing on accuracy, completeness, and consistency throughout the data pipeline.

## Context
This is Phase 4 of our incremental approach. Data quality tests ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of system data. Use Docker for consistent environments and run after system tests are stable.

## Scope
- Data accuracy and precision validation
- Data completeness and missing value detection
- Data consistency and format validation
- Data range and constraint validation
- Data integrity and relationship validation
- Data quality metrics and monitoring

## Approach
**Languages**: Python, SQL
**Frameworks**: Data validation libraries, statistical analysis, quality metrics
**Containerization**: Docker with all services
**Focus**: Data quality assurance and validation

## Success Criteria
- Data accuracy meets defined precision requirements
- Data completeness is maintained throughout the pipeline
- Data consistency is preserved across transformations
- Data ranges and constraints are properly enforced
- Data integrity and relationships are maintained
- Data quality metrics are tracked and monitored
- Data quality issues are detected and reported

## Implementation Strategy

### Test Structure
```
tests/validation/data-quality/
├── accuracy.test.py            # Python accuracy validation
├── completeness.test.py        # Python completeness checks
├── consistency.test.sql        # SQL consistency validation
├── range-validation.test.py    # Python range checks
├── integrity.test.sql          # SQL integrity checks
└── utils/
    └── quality_helpers.py      # Data quality utilities
```

### Core Test Components

#### 1. Accuracy Validation (`accuracy.test.py`)
- Validate data accuracy and precision
- Compare against reference values

#### 2. Completeness Testing (`completeness.test.py`)
- Detect missing or incomplete data
- Validate required fields

#### 3. Consistency Validation (`consistency.test.sql`)
- Check data format and schema compliance
- Validate cross-table consistency

#### 4. Range Validation (`range-validation.test.py`)
- Ensure values are within expected bounds
- Detect outliers and anomalies

#### 5. Integrity Testing (`integrity.test.sql`)
- Validate data relationships and constraints
- Check referential integrity

### Docker Integration
- Use Docker Compose to run validation tests against live data
- Aggregate results into a unified data quality report

### Test Execution
- Sequentially run accuracy, completeness, and integrity tests
- Aggregate results into a unified data quality report

## Test Scenarios
- Validate photovoltaic and wind turbine data accuracy
- Detect missing or incomplete device data
- Check schema compliance and format consistency
- Validate data ranges and constraints
- Ensure data integrity across tables

## MVP Considerations
- Focus on critical data quality measures for MVP
- Test with realistic data quality requirements
- Prioritize data accuracy over complex quality features
- Use simple quality validation for MVP phase
- Use Docker for consistent test environment

## Implementation Notes
- Use Python for statistical analysis and validation
- Use SQL for schema and integrity checks
- Aggregate results in a unified report
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper cleanup in test teardown
