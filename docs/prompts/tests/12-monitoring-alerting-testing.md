# Monitoring and Alerting Testing (Phase 4 - Validation)

## Objective
Implement health checks, monitoring, and alerting tests for the renewable energy IoT monitoring system MVP, ensuring operational visibility and proactive fault detection.

## Context
This is Phase 4 of our incremental approach. Monitoring and alerting tests ensure the system is observable and issues are detected early. Use Docker for consistent environments and run after system tests are stable.

## Scope
- System health monitoring and status checks
- Alert generation and notification mechanisms
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Log monitoring and analysis
- Service availability and uptime monitoring
- Operational dashboard and reporting

## Approach
**Languages**: Shell, JavaScript/Node.js
**Frameworks**: Health check tools, monitoring systems, alerting frameworks
**Containerization**: Docker with all services
**Focus**: System monitoring and operational visibility

## Success Criteria
- System health checks work correctly and reliably
- Alerts are generated and delivered appropriately
- Performance metrics are collected and tracked
- Log monitoring provides operational visibility
- Service availability is properly monitored
- Operational dashboards display accurate information
- Monitoring systems are resilient and fault-tolerant

## Implementation Strategy

### Test Structure
```

├── health-checks.test.sh       # Shell health checks
├── alerting.test.js            # JavaScript alerting tests
├── performance-monitoring.test.sh # Shell performance monitoring
├── log-monitoring.test.js      # JavaScript log analysis
├── availability.test.sh        # Shell service availability

```

### Core Test Components

#### 1. Health Check Testing (`health-checks.test.sh`)
- Test system health endpoints
- Validate readiness and liveness probes

#### 2. Alert Testing (`alerting.test.js`)
- Test alert generation and delivery
- Validate alert thresholds and notifications

#### 3. Performance Monitoring (`performance-monitoring.test.sh`)
- Collect and analyze performance metrics
- Alert on threshold breaches

#### 4. Log Monitoring (`log-monitoring.test.js`)
- Analyze logs for errors and anomalies
- Validate log-based alerting

#### 5. Availability Testing (`availability.test.sh`)
- Monitor service uptime and availability
- Validate failover and recovery

### Docker Integration
- Use Docker Compose to run monitoring and alerting tests
- Aggregate results into a unified monitoring report

### Test Execution
- Sequentially run health, alerting, and monitoring tests
- Aggregate results into a unified monitoring report

## Test Scenarios
- Test health endpoints for all services
- Validate alert generation and delivery
- Monitor performance metrics under load
- Analyze logs for error patterns
- Test service availability and failover

## MVP Considerations
- Focus on basic health checks and monitoring for MVP
- Test with simple alert mechanisms
- Prioritize system visibility over complex monitoring features
- Use basic monitoring tools for MVP phase
- Use Docker for consistent test environment

## Implementation Notes
- Use shell scripts for system-level health checks
- Use JavaScript for alerting and log analysis
- Aggregate results in a unified report
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper cleanup in test teardown
