# Testing and Validation Framework - MVP Project

## Overview
This directory contains testing prompts organized by the hybrid approach for the Renewable Energy IoT Monitoring System MVP.

## Testing Strategy
- **JavaScript/Node.js**: Node-RED flows, MQTT communication, data validation
- **Python**: Data analysis, complex validation, renewable energy calculations
- **SQL**: Database schema validation, query performance, data integrity
- **Shell Scripts**: System-level testing, Docker orchestration, health checks

## Task Organization

### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure
1. **01-test-directory-structure.md** - Docker-based, incremental test directory organization

### Phase 2: Foundation Testing (JavaScript/SQL/Python)
2. **02-mqtt-communication-testing.md** - JavaScript-based MQTT communication testing
3. **03-node-red-flow-testing.md** - JavaScript-based Node-RED flow testing
4. **04-database-schema-testing.md** - JavaScript/SQL database schema and data integrity testing

### Phase 3: Integration & System Testing
5. **05-end-to-end-data-flow.md** - End-to-end data pipeline validation
6. **06-device-simulation-testing.md** - Python-based device simulation testing
7. **07-performance-testing.md** - System performance validation
8. **08-error-handling-testing.md** - Error scenarios and recovery
9. **09-security-testing.md** - Authentication and authorization validation

### Phase 4: Validation Framework
10. **10-data-quality-validation.md** - Data accuracy and completeness
11. **11-business-logic-validation.md** - Renewable energy calculations and rules
12. **12-monitoring-alerting-testing.md** - Health checks and alerting system
13. **13-grafana-dashboard-testing.md** - Dashboard functionality and data visualization

## Usage
Each prompt file contains:
- **Objective**: What the test should accomplish
- **Scope**: What components are being tested
- **Approach**: Which language/framework to use
- **Success Criteria**: How to determine if the test passes
- **Implementation Notes**: Technical considerations for MVP

## MVP Considerations
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Prioritize critical path functionality
- Use realistic but manageable test data
- Focus on automated testing where possible
- Maintain quick feedback loops for development
