# Error Handling Testing (Phase 3 - System)

## Objective
Implement error scenario and recovery tests for the renewable energy IoT monitoring system MVP, validating system resilience and graceful degradation.

## Context
This is Phase 3 of our incremental approach. Error handling tests ensure the system can recover from failures and provide meaningful diagnostics. Use Docker for consistent environments and run after core and integration tests are stable.

## Scope
- Error detection and logging
- Recovery mechanisms and retry logic
- Graceful degradation and fallback options
- Error propagation and handling
- System resilience and fault tolerance
- Error reporting and monitoring

## Approach
**Languages**: JavaScript/Node.js, Python, Shell
**Frameworks**: Error simulation, logging analysis, recovery testing
**Containerization**: Docker with all services
**Focus**: System resilience and error recovery validation

## Success Criteria
- System detects and logs errors appropriately
- Recovery mechanisms work effectively
- Graceful degradation prevents system failures
- Error propagation is handled correctly
- System remains operational during partial failures
- Error reporting provides actionable information
- Recovery times are within acceptable limits

## Implementation Strategy

### Test Structure
```

├── error-detection.test.js     # JavaScript error detection
├── recovery.test.py            # Python recovery logic
├── graceful-degradation.test.sh # Shell fallback tests
├── error-propagation.test.js   # Error propagation validation
├── fault-tolerance.test.py     # System resilience tests

    └── error_helpers.js        # Error handling utilities
```

### Core Test Components

#### 1. Error Detection (`error-detection.test.js`)
- Simulate common error scenarios
- Validate error logging and reporting

#### 2. Recovery Testing (`recovery.test.py`)
- Test retry logic and recovery mechanisms
- Validate system state after recovery

#### 3. Graceful Degradation (`graceful-degradation.test.sh`)
- Simulate partial system failures
- Validate fallback and continued operation

#### 4. Error Propagation (`error-propagation.test.js`)
- Test error handling across system components
- Ensure errors do not cascade uncontrollably

#### 5. Fault Tolerance (`fault-tolerance.test.py`)
- Validate system resilience to various failures
- Test redundancy and failover mechanisms

### Docker Integration
- Use Docker Compose to simulate service failures
- Monitor logs and system state during errors
- Validate recovery and fallback in containerized environment

### Test Execution
- Sequentially run error, recovery, and degradation tests
- Aggregate results into a unified error handling report

## Test Scenarios
- Simulate MQTT broker outage and recovery
- Node-RED flow error and fallback
- InfluxDB write failure and retry
- Grafana data source error handling
- System-wide error propagation and logging

## MVP Considerations
- Focus on critical error scenarios for MVP
- Test with realistic failure conditions
- Prioritize system stability over complex error handling
- Use simple error recovery mechanisms for MVP phase
- Use Docker for consistent test environment

## Implementation Notes
- Use mocks and stubs for error simulation
- Validate logs for error reporting
- Aggregate results in a unified report
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper cleanup in test teardown
