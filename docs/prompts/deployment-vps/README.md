## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues and Solutions:**

#### **Issue 1: Memory Exhaustion**
```bash
# Symptoms: Container restarts, slow performance
# Solution: Optimize resource limits
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```
**What this means:** Your server is running out of memory (RAM). This happens when your applications try to use more memory than your server has available.

#### **Issue 2: Service Startup Failures**
```bash
# Symptoms: Services not starting
# Solution: Check logs and dependencies
docker-compose logs [service-name]
docker-compose ps
```
**What this means:** One or more of your applications isn't starting properly. This could be due to configuration errors, missing files, or resource issues.

#### **Issue 3: Data Persistence Issues**
```bash
# Symptoms: Data loss after restart
# Solution: Verify volume mounts
docker volume ls
docker volume inspect [volume-name]
```
**What this means:** Your data is disappearing when you restart your applications. This usually means your data isn't being saved to the right place.

#### **Issue 4: Network Connectivity**
```bash
# Symptoms: Services can't communicate
# Solution: Check Docker network
docker network ls
docker network inspect iot-network
```
**What this means:** Your applications can't talk to each other. This is like having a broken phone line between different parts of your system.

#### **Issue 5: Windows SSH Connection Problems**
```bash
# Symptoms: Can't connect from Windows
# Solution: Check SSH client configuration
# For PuTTY: Verify hostname, port, and key settings
# For Windows Terminal: Use ssh username@server-ip
```
**What this means:** You can't connect to your server from your Windows computer. This could be due to incorrect SSH settings or network issues.

## üîí Security Considerations

### **Security Measures Implemented:**

#### **Network Security:**
- SSH key-based authentication - Using a special "key" to log into your server (more secure than passwords)
- Firewall configuration (UFW) - A "security guard" that only allows authorized connections
- Non-standard SSH port (2222) - Using a different "door" than the standard one (makes it harder for hackers to find)
- Fail2ban protection - A system that automatically blocks suspicious activity

#### **Application Security:**
- Non-root Docker containers - Running your applications with limited permissions (safer)
- Environment variable protection - Keeping sensitive information (like passwords) in secure files
- Secure token management - Using secure "keys" for accessing your data
- HTTPS headers (when applicable) - Encrypting data when it travels over the internet

#### **Data Security:**
- Regular backup procedures - Making copies of your data regularly
- Data encryption at rest - Encrypting your data when it's stored on the server
- Access control implementation - Controlling who can access your data
- Audit logging - Keeping records of who accessed what and when

#### **Mikrus-Specific Security:**
- **DDoS Protection**: Basic DDoS protection included with Mikrus servers
- **Backup System**: Automatic daily backups included
- **Monitoring**: Built-in server monitoring tools
- **Control Panel**: Web-based control panel for easy management
