# Phase 6: Container Orchestration and Integration

## Overview
Phase 6 focuses on transforming the MVP renewable energy monitoring system from a development setup to a production-ready containerized solution. This phase implements comprehensive container orchestration, monitoring, security, and operational procedures.

## Current Project State
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose with all services (Mosquitto, InfluxDB, Node-RED, Grafana)
- ✅ **Data Flow**: MQTT → Node-RED → InfluxDB → Grafana pipeline operational
- ✅ **Basic Operations**: Health checks, service dependencies, startup scripts
- ❌ **Production Readiness**: Resource limits, security hardening, monitoring
- ❌ **Operational Procedures**: Backup, deployment, maintenance automation
