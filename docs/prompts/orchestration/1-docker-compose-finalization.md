# Task 1: Docker Compose Finalization and Resource Optimization

## Objective
Finalize the Docker Compose configuration with production-ready resource limits, constraints, and optimizations for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) renewable energy monitoring system.

## Current State
- ✅ Basic Docker Compose configuration exists with all services
- ✅ Health checks implemented for all services
- ✅ Service dependencies configured
- ✅ Custom network setup
- ❌ Resource limits and constraints missing
- ❌ Production optimizations needed

## Tasks

### 1.1 Add Resource Limits and Constraints
- [ ] Add memory limits for each service:
  - Mosquitto: 256MB
  - InfluxDB: 1GB
  - Node-RED: 512MB
  - Grafana: 512MB
  - InfluxDB Admin: 128MB
- [ ] Add CPU limits (0.5 cores per service)
- [ ] Add restart policies with exponential backoff
- [ ] Configure ulimits for file descriptors

### 1.2 Optimize Container Configuration
- [ ] Add multi-stage builds for custom images
- [ ] Optimize base images (use alpine where possible)
- [ ] Configure proper user permissions
- [ ] Add security scanning labels
- [ ] Implement proper logging drivers

### 1.3 Environment-Specific Configurations
- [ ] Create docker-compose.override.yml for development
- [ ] Create docker-compose.prod.yml for production
- [ ] Add environment-specific volume configurations
- [ ] Configure different resource limits per environment

### 1.4 Security Hardening
- [ ] Add security labels
- [ ] Configure read-only root filesystems where possible
- [ ] Add no-new-privileges flag
- [ ] Implement proper user namespace mapping
- [ ] Add security scanning in CI/CD

## Deliverables
- [ ] Updated docker-compose.yml with resource limits
- [ ] docker-compose.override.yml for development
- [ ] docker-compose.prod.yml for production
- [ ] Security configuration documentation
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring setup

## Success Criteria
- All services have appropriate resource limits
- Security best practices implemented
- Environment-specific configurations available
- Resource usage is optimized for MVP scale
- Configuration follows Docker Compose 3.8+ standards

## Estimated Effort
- **Time**: 4-6 hours
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Priority**: High (foundation for other tasks)
