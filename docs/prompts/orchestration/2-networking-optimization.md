# Task 2: Networking Optimization and Service Discovery

## Objective
Optimize the Docker networking configuration for better service isolation, security, and discovery in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) renewable energy monitoring system.

## Current State
- ✅ Basic custom bridge network `iot-network` exists
- ✅ Services can communicate by name
- ✅ Port exposures configured
- ❌ Network segmentation missing
- ❌ Service discovery optimization needed
- ❌ Network security policies missing

## Tasks

### 2.1 Network Segmentation
- [ ] Create separate networks for different service tiers:
  - `iot-frontend-network` (Grafana, InfluxDB Admin)
  - `iot-backend-network` (Node-RED, InfluxDB)
  - `iot-mqtt-network` (Mosquitto)
- [ ] Configure network isolation policies
- [ ] Implement proper network routing between tiers
- [ ] Add network security groups

### 2.2 Service Discovery Enhancement
- [ ] Configure DNS resolution for service names
- [ ] Add service aliases for better naming
- [ ] Implement service health check endpoints
- [ ] Configure load balancing for high availability
- [ ] Add service registration and discovery

### 2.3 Network Security
- [ ] Implement network policies
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Add network encryption (TLS)
- [ ] Implement network monitoring
- [ ] Add network access logging

### 2.4 Port Management
- [ ] Optimize port exposures for security
- [ ] Configure internal-only services
- [ ] Add port health checks
- [ ] Implement port conflict resolution
- [ ] Add port usage documentation

## Deliverables
- [ ] Updated network configuration in docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Network security policies
- [ ] Service discovery documentation
- [ ] Network monitoring setup
- [ ] Port management guide

## Success Criteria
- Services are properly isolated by network tiers
- Service discovery works reliably
- Network security is implemented
- Port management is optimized
- Network performance is monitored

## Estimated Effort
- **Time**: 3-4 hours
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Priority**: High (security and performance)
