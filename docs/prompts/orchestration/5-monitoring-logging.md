# Task 5: Centralized Monitoring and Logging

## Objective
Implement comprehensive centralized monitoring and logging for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) renewable energy monitoring system.

## Current State
- ✅ Basic health checks implemented
- ✅ Individual service logging configured
- ❌ Centralized logging missing
- ❌ System monitoring missing
- ❌ Alerting system missing

## Tasks

### 5.1 Centralized Logging Setup
- [ ] Implement centralized logging with ELK stack or similar:
  - Elasticsearch for log storage
  - Logstash for log processing
  - Kibana for log visualization
- [ ] Configure log aggregation for all services
- [ ] Implement log rotation and retention
- [ ] Add structured logging
- [ ] Configure log search and filtering

### 5.2 System Monitoring
- [ ] Implement system metrics collection:
  - Container resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
  - Network performance
  - Service response times
  - Database performance metrics
- [ ] Set up monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Configure metric retention policies
- [ ] Implement performance baselines
- [ ] Add capacity planning metrics

### 5.3 Alerting System
- [ ] Configure alerting rules:
  - Service health alerts
  - Resource usage alerts
  - Performance degradation alerts
  - Security alerts
- [ ] Set up notification channels:
  - Email notifications
  - Slack/Teams integration
  - SMS alerts (for critical issues)
- [ ] Implement alert escalation procedures
- [ ] Configure alert suppression rules

### 5.4 Health Check Enhancement
- [ ] Enhance existing health checks
- [ ] Add application-level health checks
- [ ] Implement health check aggregation
- [ ] Configure health check reporting
- [ ] Add health check history tracking

## Deliverables
- [ ] Centralized logging configuration
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Alerting system setup
- [ ] Health check enhancement
- [ ] Monitoring documentation

## Success Criteria
- All logs are centralized and searchable
- System performance is monitored
- Alerts are configured and tested
- Health checks are comprehensive
- Monitoring is real-time and actionable

## Estimated Effort
- **Time**: 6-8 hours
- **Complexity**: High
- **Priority**: High (operational visibility)
