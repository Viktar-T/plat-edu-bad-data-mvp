# Task 7: Backup and Recovery (Phase 1)

## **Objective**
Implement essential backup and recovery capabilities to protect data in InfluxDB 3.x.

## **Core Features to Implement**

### **Manual Backup System**
- **Create Backup**: One-click manual backup creation
- **Backup Progress**: Show backup progress with percentage
- **Backup List**: Display all available backups with dates
- **Backup Details**: Show backup size, duration, and status
- **Backup Naming**: Simple naming with timestamps
- **Local Storage**: Store backups in local filesystem

### **Simple Restore Operations**
- **Restore Interface**: Select backup and restore database
- **Restore Preview**: Show what will be restored before proceeding
- **Restore Progress**: Display restoration progress
- **Restore Confirmation**: Require confirmation before restoring
- **Restore Logging**: Log restore operations and results

### **Backup Scheduling**
- **Daily Backups**: Simple daily backup scheduling
- **Backup Times**: Configure what time backups run
- **Schedule Management**: Enable/disable scheduled backups
- **Schedule Status**: Show next scheduled backup time
- **Schedule History**: List of recent scheduled backup results

### **Basic Monitoring**
- **Backup Status**: Green/red indicators for backup health
- **Success/Failure Tracking**: Track backup success rates
- **Storage Usage**: Show total space used by backups
- **Recent Operations**: List recent backup/restore activities
- **Simple Alerts**: Email alerts for backup failures

## **Technical Requirements**

### **Backup Engine**
- Direct API calls to InfluxDB for data export
- File compression for backup storage
- Progress tracking during operations
- Error handling and retry logic
- Metadata storage for backup information

### **Scheduling System**
- Simple cron-like scheduling
- Background job execution
- Schedule persistence
- Notification system for results
- Basic job queue management

### **Storage Management**
- Local file system storage
- Basic disk space monitoring
- File organization and naming
- Backup retention policies
- Storage location configuration

## **Success Criteria**
- Users can create backups easily and reliably
- Restore operations work without data loss
- Scheduled backups run automatically
- Backup status is clearly visible
- System alerts users to backup problems

## **Implementation Steps**
1. Build manual backup creation functionality
2. Add backup listing and management interface
3. Implement basic restore capabilities
4. Create simple backup scheduling
5. Add monitoring and alerting

## **Files to Modify/Create**
- `influxdb-web-interface/js/backup-manager.js` - Backup operations
- `influxdb-web-interface/js/scheduler.js` - Backup scheduling
- `influxdb-web-interface/backup.html` - Backup management interface
- `influxdb/backups/` - Directory for backup storage
