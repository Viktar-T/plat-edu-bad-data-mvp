# Task 5: Performance Monitoring (Phase 1)

## **Objective**
Implement basic performance monitoring to track InfluxDB 3.x system health and query performance.

## **Core Features to Implement**

### **Basic Performance Dashboard**
- **System Metrics**: Simple CPU, memory, and disk usage displays
- **Query Performance**: Show average query execution times
- **Connection Status**: Display database connection health
- **Recent Activity**: List of recent queries and operations
- **Simple Charts**: Basic line charts for key metrics over time

### **Query Performance Monitor**
- **Slow Query Detection**: List queries that take longer than threshold
- **Query Execution Times**: Show execution time for each query
- **Active Queries**: Display currently running queries
- **Query Frequency**: Show most frequently executed queries
- **Basic Performance Metrics**: Response time, rows returned, errors

### **Simple Alerting**
- **Threshold Alerts**: Simple alerts when metrics exceed limits
- **Email Notifications**: Basic email alerts for critical issues
- **Alert History**: List of recent alerts and their status
- **Alert Configuration**: Simple forms to set alert thresholds
- **Dashboard Indicators**: Visual indicators when alerts are active

### **Connection Monitoring**
- **Active Connections**: Count of current database connections
- **Connection Health**: Simple green/red status indicators
- **Connection History**: Basic log of connection events
- **Connection Errors**: Display recent connection failures
- **Response Times**: Monitor database response times

## **Technical Requirements**

### **Metrics Collection**
- Basic system metrics from InfluxDB APIs
- Query performance tracking
- Simple metrics storage in memory
- Periodic metric collection (every 30 seconds)
- Basic metric aggregation

### **Visualization**
- Simple chart library for basic graphs
- Real-time updates of key metrics
- Color-coded status indicators
- Responsive design for different screens
- Basic dashboard layout

### **Alerting System**
- Simple threshold-based alerting
- Basic email notification system
- Alert state management
- Simple notification templates
- Alert acknowledgment

## **Success Criteria**
- Dashboard shows current system health clearly
- Slow queries are identified and displayed
- Basic alerts notify users of issues
- Performance trends are visible over time
- Monitoring has minimal impact on system performance

## **Implementation Steps**
1. Build basic metrics collection system
2. Create simple performance dashboard
3. Add query performance monitoring
4. Implement basic alerting functionality
5. Set up connection health monitoring

## **Files to Modify/Create**
- `influxdb/web/js/performance-monitor.js` - Metrics collection and display
- `influxdb/web/js/alerts.js` - Simple alerting system
- `influxdb/web/performance.html` - Performance dashboard page
- Include simple charting library (Chart.js or similar)
