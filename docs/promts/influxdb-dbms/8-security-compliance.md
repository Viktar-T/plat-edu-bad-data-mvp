# Task 8: Security and Compliance (Phase 1)

## **Objective**
Implement basic security features and compliance logging for InfluxDB 3.x management system.

## **Core Features to Implement**

### **Basic Encryption**
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Require HTTPS for web interface access
- **Session Encryption**: Encrypt user session data
- **Password Hashing**: Secure password storage with bcrypt
- **API Token Security**: Secure API token generation and storage
- **Basic Key Management**: Simple encryption key storage and rotation

### **Access Control**
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Admin vs User access levels
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with timeouts
- **Password Policies**: Basic password strength requirements
- **Account Lockout**: Lock accounts after failed login attempts

### **Audit Logging**
- **User Activity Logging**: Log all user actions and changes
- **Login Attempt Logging**: Track successful and failed logins
- **Database Operation Logging**: Log database create/delete/modify operations
- **Backup Operation Logging**: Track backup and restore activities
- **Log File Management**: Rotate and manage audit log files

### **Basic Compliance**
- **Data Access Logging**: Log who accessed what data when
- **Change Tracking**: Track all configuration and data changes
- **User Management Logging**: Log user account changes
- **Compliance Reports**: Simple reports for audit purposes
- **Data Retention Policies**: Basic rules for keeping audit logs

## **Technical Requirements**

### **Security Infrastructure**
- SSL/TLS certificate management
- Secure session storage
- Password encryption and validation
- Input sanitization and validation
- Basic intrusion detection

### **Logging System**
- Structured logging format (JSON)
- Log rotation and archival
- Log search and filtering
- Tamper-evident logging
- Performance-optimized logging

### **Compliance Framework**
- Audit trail maintenance
- Report generation
- Data classification basics
- Access control documentation
- Policy enforcement

## **Success Criteria**
- All communications are encrypted (HTTPS)
- User authentication is secure and reliable
- All important actions are logged
- Basic compliance requirements are met
- Security doesn't significantly impact performance

## **Implementation Steps**
1. Set up HTTPS and basic encryption
2. Implement secure authentication system
3. Build comprehensive audit logging
4. Create basic compliance reporting
5. Add security monitoring and alerts
