# Task 3: Query Management (Phase 1)

## **Objective**
Develop basic query management tools for writing, executing, and managing SQL queries in InfluxDB 3.x.

## **Core Features to Implement**

### **Simple Query Editor**
- **Text Editor**: Basic SQL editor with syntax highlighting
- **Query Execution**: Execute button to run queries
- **Multiple Tabs**: Support for multiple query tabs
- **Basic Auto-complete**: Simple auto-complete for database and measurement names
- **Error Display**: Show query errors with line numbers
- **Query Formatting**: Basic SQL formatting functionality

### **Query Execution and Results**
- **Result Display**: Show query results in a data table
- **Progress Indicator**: Show query execution progress
- **Execution Time**: Display how long queries took to run
- **Row Count**: Show number of rows returned
- **Export Results**: Basic CSV export of query results
- **Query Cancellation**: Ability to cancel long-running queries

### **Query History**
- **Recent Queries**: List of recently executed queries
- **Query Storage**: Save and load frequently used queries
- **Execution Log**: Log of all executed queries with timestamps
- **Quick Re-run**: One-click to re-execute previous queries
- **Simple Search**: Search through query history

## **Technical Requirements**

### **Editor Technology**
- Use a simple code editor library (like CodeMirror)
- Basic SQL syntax highlighting
- Line numbers and basic navigation
- Simple auto-completion functionality

### **Query Execution**
- Direct connection to InfluxDB 3.x HTTP API
- Async query execution with progress tracking
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Query timeout management
- Result pagination for large datasets

### **Data Management**
- Store query history in browser localStorage
- Basic query result caching
- Simple export functionality
- Session persistence for open tabs

## **Success Criteria**
- Users can write and execute SQL queries easily
- Query results display clearly and quickly
- Query history helps users find and reuse queries
- Error messages are helpful and actionable
- Interface is responsive and user-friendly

## **Implementation Steps**
1. Integrate basic code editor with SQL syntax highlighting
2. Build query execution engine with InfluxDB API
3. Create result display table with pagination
4. Add query history and storage functionality
5. Implement basic export and sharing features

## **Files to Modify/Create**
- `influxdb/web/js/query-editor.js` - Query editor functionality
- `influxdb/web/js/query-executor.js` - Query execution and results
- `influxdb/web/js/query-history.js` - Query history management
- Include CodeMirror or similar library for editor
