# Task 3: Volume Management and Data Persistence

## Objective
Implement comprehensive volume management for data persistence, backup, and recovery in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) renewable energy monitoring system.

## Current State
- ✅ Basic volume mounts configured for all services
- ✅ Named volumes defined in docker-compose.yml
- ❌ Volume backup procedures missing
- ❌ Data retention policies not implemented
- ❌ Volume monitoring missing

## Tasks

### 3.1 Volume Configuration Optimization
- [ ] Configure named volumes with proper drivers
- [ ] Set up volume labels for organization
- [ ] Implement volume size limits
- [ ] Configure volume backup locations
- [ ] Add volume health monitoring

### 3.2 Data Retention and Cleanup
- [ ] Implement data retention policies:
  - Raw sensor data: 7 days
  - Aggregated data: 30 days
  - Historical data: 1 year
- [ ] Configure automatic data cleanup
- [ ] Set up data archiving procedures
- [ ] Implement data compression
- [ ] Add data lifecycle management

### 3.3 Backup and Recovery Procedures
- [ ] Create automated backup scripts:
  - Database backups (InfluxDB)
  - Configuration backups
  - Volume snapshots
- [ ] Implement backup verification
- [ ] Set up backup retention policies
- [ ] Create disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Test backup and recovery processes

### 3.4 Volume Monitoring and Maintenance
- [ ] Implement volume usage monitoring
- [ ] Set up volume performance metrics
- [ ] Configure volume alerts
- [ ] Add volume maintenance procedures
- [ ] Implement volume optimization

## Deliverables
- [ ] Updated volume configuration in docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Backup scripts (backup.sh, restore.sh)
- [ ] Data retention policies
- [ ] Volume monitoring setup
- [ ] Disaster recovery documentation

## Success Criteria
- All data is properly persisted
- Backup procedures are automated and tested
- Data retention policies are implemented
- Volume performance is monitored
- Recovery procedures are documented and tested

## Estimated Effort
- **Time**: 4-5 hours
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Priority**: High (data protection)
