# Task 4: Service Dependencies and Startup Optimization

## Objective
Optimize service dependencies, startup order, and graceful shutdown procedures for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) renewable energy monitoring system.

## Current State
- ✅ Basic service dependencies configured
- ✅ Health checks implemented
- ✅ Startup script exists
- ❌ Graceful shutdown procedures missing
- ❌ Dependency resolution optimization needed
- ❌ Startup time optimization missing

## Tasks

### 4.1 Dependency Resolution Enhancement
- [ ] Optimize service startup order:
  1. Mosquitto (MQTT broker)
  2. InfluxDB (database)
  3. Node-RED (data processing)
  4. Grafana (visualization)
  5. InfluxDB Admin (web interface)
- [ ] Implement proper dependency chains
- [ ] Add dependency timeout handling
- [ ] Configure retry mechanisms
- [ ] Add dependency health validation

### 4.2 Startup Time Optimization
- [ ] Optimize container startup times
- [ ] Implement parallel startup where possible
- [ ] Add startup progress monitoring
- [ ] Configure startup timeouts
- [ ] Implement startup failure recovery

### 4.3 Graceful Shutdown Procedures
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown for all services
- [ ] Add shutdown signal handling
- [ ] Configure shutdown timeouts
- [ ] Implement data preservation during shutdown
- [ ] Add shutdown logging and monitoring

### 4.4 Service Health and Recovery
- [ ] Enhance health check configurations
- [ ] Implement service recovery procedures
- [ ] Add service restart policies
- [ ] Configure service monitoring
- [ ] Implement automatic failover

## Deliverables
- [ ] Updated service dependencies in docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Enhanced startup script with progress monitoring
- [ ] Graceful shutdown procedures
- [ ] Service recovery documentation
- [ ] Startup time optimization guide

## Success Criteria
- Services start in optimal order
- Startup time is minimized
- Graceful shutdown preserves data
- Service recovery is automatic
- Health monitoring is comprehensive

## Estimated Effort
- **Time**: 3-4 hours
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Priority**: Medium (operational efficiency)
