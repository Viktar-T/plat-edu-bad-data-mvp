# üöÄ Phase 2: Application Deployment

> **Deploy and configure the renewable energy IoT monitoring system on Mikrus VPS**

## üìã Overview

This phase covers the deployment of all application components using Docker Compose, optimized for Mikrus VPS specifications. The deployment includes MQTT broker, InfluxDB database, Node-RED data processing, Grafana visualization, and custom web applications (Express backend + React frontend).

### üéØ What is Application Deployment?
Application deployment is like setting up all the programs on your server. Think of it like installing apps on your phone - you need to install each app, configure its settings, and make sure they can talk to each other. In this case, we're setting up several applications that work together to monitor renewable energy systems.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Phase 1 completed - Your server is set up and secure
- ‚úÖ Docker and Docker Compose installed - The "container system" is ready
- ‚úÖ SSH access from Windows - You can connect to your server
- ‚úÖ Project files ready for transfer - Your code is ready to copy to the server

### üìÅ Required Files
- `docker-compose.yml` (optimized for Mikrus VPS) - The "recipe" that tells Docker how to set up all your applications
- `.env` file with environment variables - The settings your applications need
- Web application files (Express backend + React frontend) - Your custom website files
- Configuration files for each service - Settings for each part of your system

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment

### **Step 1: File Transfer from Windows**

#### **1.1 Transfer Project Files**

**Option A: Using WinSCP (Recommended for Windows)**
1. Download WinSCP from https://winscp.net/
2. Open WinSCP and connect to your server:
   - **Host name**: Your server IP address
   - **Port**: 2222 (or your custom SSH port)
   - **User name**: Your username
   - **Password**: Your password (or use SSH key)
3. Navigate to your project directory on Windows
4. Drag and drop files to the server

**Option B: Using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**
```bash
# Open WSL and transfer files
scp -r ./renewable-energy-iot username@your-server-ip:/home/username/

# Or use rsync for better performance
rsync -avz --progress ./renewable-energy-iot/ username@your-server-ip:/home/username/renewable-energy-iot/
```

**Option C: Using VS Code Remote SSH**
1. Install VS Code Remote SSH extension
2. Connect to your server via VS Code
3. Open the project folder directly on the server
4. Edit files directly on the server

#### **1.2 Verify File Transfer**
```bash
# Connect to your server
ssh username@your-server-ip

# Navigate to project directory
cd ~/renewable-energy-iot

# List files to verify transfer
ls -la

# Check if all required files are present
ls -la docker-compose.yml .env
```

**What this means:** You're copying your project files from your Windows computer to your server. This is like copying files from your computer to a USB drive, but over the internet.

---

### **Step 2: Docker Compose Configuration**

#### **2.1 Optimize Docker Compose for Mikrus VPS**
```bash
# Edit the docker-compose.yml file
nano docker-compose.yml
```

**Replace with this optimized configuration:**
```yaml
version: '3.8'

**What this configuration does:**
- **Resource Limits**: Each service has memory and CPU limits to prevent one service from using all resources
- **Health Checks**: Each service has health checks to ensure they're working properly
- **Dependencies**: Services start in the right order (core services first, then applications that depend on them)
- **Networking**: All services can communicate with each other through the `iot-network`
- **Volumes**: Data is stored persistently so it survives container restarts

#### **2.2 Service Explanations**

**MQTT Broker (Mosquitto):**
- **Purpose**: The "post office" that receives messages from IoT devices
- **Memory**: 50-100MB (very lightweight)
- **Port**: 1883 (MQTT), 9001 (WebSocket)
- **Health Check**: Publishes a test message to verify it's working

**InfluxDB Database:**
- **Purpose**: The "filing cabinet" that stores time-series data
- **Memory**: 512MB-1GB (uses more resources because it stores all your data)
- **Port**: 8086 (HTTP API)
- **Health Check**: Checks if the web interface is responding

**Node-RED:**
- **Purpose**: The "digital plumber" that connects different parts of your system
- **Memory**: 200-400MB (moderate usage)
- **Port**: 1880 (web interface)
- **Health Check**: Checks if the web interface is responding

**Grafana:**
- **Purpose**: The "digital artist" that creates charts and dashboards
- **Memory**: 150-300MB (moderate usage)
- **Port**: 3000 (web interface)
- **Health Check**: Checks if the web interface is responding

**Express Backend:**
- **Purpose**: The "brain" of your custom website (API server)
- **Memory**: 100-200MB (lightweight)
- **Port**: 3001 (API)
- **Health Check**: Checks if the API is responding

**React Frontend:**
- **Purpose**: The "face" of your custom website (user interface)
- **Memory**: 75-150MB (lightweight)
- **Port**: 3002 (web interface)
- **Health Check**: Checks if the web interface is responding

**What these configurations do:**
- **Express Backend**: A Node.js API server that connects to InfluxDB and provides data to the frontend
- **React Frontend**: A modern web application that displays your data in a user-friendly interface
- **Nginx**: A web server that serves the React app and proxies API requests to the Express backend
- **Security**: Non-root users, security headers, and proper file permissions
- **Performance**: Gzip compression, caching, and optimized static file serving

docker-compose logs mosquitto influxdb
```

#### **4.2 Start Processing Services**
```bash
# Start Node-RED (data processing)
docker-compose up -d node-red

# Wait for Node-RED to be healthy
docker-compose ps

# Check Node-RED logs
docker-compose logs node-red
```

#### **4.3 Start Visualization Services**
```bash
# Start Grafana (visualization)
docker-compose up -d grafana

# Wait for Grafana to be healthy
docker-compose ps

# Check Grafana logs
docker-compose logs grafana
```

#### **4.4 Start Web Application**
```bash
# Start Express backend and React frontend
docker-compose up -d express-backend react-frontend

# Wait for all services to be healthy
docker-compose ps

# Check all logs
docker-compose logs
```

#### **4.5 Verify All Services**
```bash
# Check all container status
docker-compose ps

# Check resource usage
docker stats --no-stream

# Test service connectivity
curl -f http://localhost:8086/health  # InfluxDB
curl -f http://localhost:1880         # Node-RED
curl -f http://localhost:3000/api/health  # Grafana
curl -f http://localhost:3001/health  # Express Backend
curl -f http://localhost:3002         # React Frontend
```

```bash
# Create performance monitoring script
nano ~/performance-monitor.sh
```

**Add this content:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "=== Mikrus VPS Performance Monitor ==="
echo "Date: $(date)"
echo ""

echo "=== System Resources ==="
echo "CPU Load: $(uptime | awk -F'load average:' '{print $2}')"
echo "Memory Usage: $(free -h | grep Mem | awk '{print $3"/"$2}')"
echo "Disk Usage: $(df -h / | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}')"
echo ""

echo "=== Docker Container Status ==="
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}\t{{.Size}}"
echo ""

echo "=== Container Resource Usage ==="
docker stats --no-stream --format "table {{.Container}}\t{{.CPUPerc}}\t{{.MemUsage}}\t{{.NetIO}}\t{{.BlockIO}}"
echo ""

echo "=== Service Health Checks ==="
echo "MQTT Broker: $(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:1883 || echo "DOWN")"
echo "InfluxDB: $(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8086/health || echo "DOWN")"

# Test React frontend connectivity
curl -f http://localhost:3002
```

#### **7.2 Web Interface Access Tests**
```bash
# Test from Windows browser:
# MQTT: http://your-server-ip:1883 (if web interface available)
# InfluxDB: http://your-server-ip:8086
# Node-RED: http://your-server-ip:1880
# Grafana: http://your-server-ip:3000
# Express API: http://your-server-ip:3001

### **Step 8: Performance Metrics**

#### **8.1 Resource Usage on Mikrus VPS:**

| Service | Memory | CPU | Storage | Status | What This Means |
|---------|--------|-----|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **MQTT Broker** | 50-100MB | 0.1-0.2 cores | 100MB | ‚úÖ Lightweight | The "post office" - very efficient |
| **InfluxDB** | 512MB-1GB | 0.5-1.0 cores | 5-10GB | ‚ö†Ô∏è Resource-intensive | The "filing cabinet" - uses more resources but stores all your data |
| **Node-RED** | 200-400MB | 0.2-0.5 cores | 500MB | ‚úÖ Moderate | The "digital plumber" - moderate resource usage |
| **Grafana** | 150-300MB | 0.1-0.3 cores | 1GB | ‚úÖ Moderate | The "digital artist" - moderate resource usage |
| **Express Backend** | 100-200MB | 0.1-0.3 cores | 100MB | ‚úÖ Lightweight | Your custom website's "brain" - very efficient |
| **React Frontend** | 75-150MB | 0.1-0.2 cores | 200MB | ‚úÖ Lightweight | Your custom website's "face" - very efficient |
| **System Overhead** | 200-400MB | 0.5 core | 2GB | ‚úÖ Acceptable | The operating system and basic tools |

**Total Expected Usage:**
- **Memory**: 1.2-2.2GB (within 2GB limit for Mikrus 3.0) - You're using most of your available memory, but it should work
- **CPU**: 1.1-2.5 cores (within 2 core limit for Mikrus 3.0) - You're using most of your available CPU power, but it should work
- **Storage**: 8-14GB (within 25GB limit for Mikrus 3.0) - You have plenty of storage space left

#### **8.2 Performance Optimization Tips:**
- **Monitor regularly**: Use the performance monitor script
- **Scale if needed**: Consider upgrading to Mikrus 3.5 for more resources
- **Optimize data retention**: Reduce InfluxDB retention period if storage is limited
- **Use resource limits**: Docker resource limits prevent one service from using all resources

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues and Solutions:**

#### **Issue 1: Memory Exhaustion**
```bash
# Symptoms: Container restarts, slow performance
# Solution: Optimize resource limits
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d

# Check memory usage
free -h
docker stats
```

**What this means:** Your server is running out of memory (RAM). This happens when your applications try to use more memory than your server has available.

#### **Issue 2: Container Startup Failures**
```bash
# Symptoms: Services not starting
# Solution: Check logs and dependencies
docker-compose logs [service-name]
docker-compose ps

# Check container status
docker ps -a
```

**What this means:** One or more of your applications isn't starting properly. This could be due to configuration errors, missing files, or resource issues.

#### **Issue 3: Network Connectivity**
```bash
# Symptoms: Services can't communicate
# Solution: Check Docker network
docker network ls
docker network inspect iot-network

# Test inter-service communication
docker exec iot-node-red ping influxdb
```

**What this means:** Your applications can't talk to each other. This is like having a broken phone line between different parts of your system.

#### **Issue 4: Data Persistence Issues**
```bash
# Symptoms: Data loss after restart
# Solution: Verify volume mounts
docker volume ls
docker volume inspect [volume-name]

# Check data directories
ls -la ./influxdb/data/
ls -la ./mosquitto/data/
```

**What this means:** Your data is disappearing when you restart your applications. This usually means your data isn't being saved to the right place.

#### **Issue 5: Web Interface Access Problems**
```bash
# Symptoms: Can't access web interfaces from Windows
# Solution: Check firewall and port configuration
sudo ufw status
netstat -tlnp | grep -E ":(3000|3001|3002|1880|8086)"

# Test from server
curl -f http://localhost:3000
```

**What this means:** You can't access your web applications from your Windows computer. This could be due to firewall settings or network configuration.
