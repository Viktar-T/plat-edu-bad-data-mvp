# Grafana Dashboard Testing (Phase 4 - Validation)

## Objective
Implement dashboard functionality and data visualization tests for the renewable energy IoT monitoring system MVP, focusing on Grafana integration and real-time data display.

## Context
This is Phase 4 of our incremental approach. Grafana dashboard tests ensure that data is visualized accurately and dashboards are responsive. Use Docker for consistent environments and run after system tests are stable.

## Scope
- Grafana dashboard functionality and responsiveness
- Data source connectivity and query execution
- Visualization accuracy and real-time updates
- Alert rule validation and notification
- Dashboard performance and user experience
- Data refresh and update mechanisms

## Approach
**Languages**: JavaScript/Node.js, SQL
**Frameworks**: Grafana API, InfluxDB queries, browser automation
**Containerization**: Docker with Grafana and InfluxDB
**Focus**: Dashboard functionality and data visualization accuracy

## Success Criteria
- Dashboards display data accurately and in real-time
- Data source connections are stable and reliable
- Queries execute efficiently and return correct results
- Visualizations represent data accurately
- Alert rules trigger correctly based on thresholds
- Dashboard performance meets user experience requirements
- Data refresh mechanisms work reliably

### Core Test Components

#### 1. Dashboard Functionality (`dashboard-functionality.test.js`)
- Test dashboard loading and responsiveness
- Validate widget and panel functionality

#### 2. Data Source Connectivity (`data-source.test.js`)
- Test InfluxDB data source connection
- Validate query execution and results

#### 3. Visualization Testing (`visualization.test.js`)
- Test chart and graph accuracy
- Validate real-time data updates

#### 4. Alert Testing (`alerting.test.js`)
- Test alert rule triggers and notifications
- Validate alert thresholds and delivery

#### 5. Performance Testing (`performance.test.js`)
- Test dashboard responsiveness and load times
- Validate performance under data load

### Docker Integration
- Use Docker Compose to run Grafana and InfluxDB
- Run dashboard tests from a dedicated test container
- Aggregate results into a unified dashboard report

### Test Execution
- Sequentially run dashboard, data source, and visualization tests
- Aggregate results into a unified dashboard report

## Test Scenarios
- Test dashboard initialization and data loading
- Validate InfluxDB connection stability
- Validate query results and performance
- Test chart and graph accuracy
- Test data refresh and real-time display
- Validate alert rule triggers and notifications
- Test dashboard responsiveness and load times

## MVP Considerations
- Focus on core renewable energy dashboards first
- Test with realistic but manageable data volumes
- Prioritize data accuracy over complex visualizations
- Use simple alert rules for MVP phase
- Use Docker for consistent test environment

## Implementation Notes
- Use Grafana API for dashboard testing
- Validate InfluxDB queries for accuracy
- Use browser automation for UI validation
- Aggregate results in a unified report
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper cleanup in test teardown
