# Performance Testing (Phase 3 - System)

## Objective
Implement system performance validation for the renewable energy IoT monitoring system MVP, focusing on response times, throughput, and resource utilization under load.

## Context
This is Phase 3 of our incremental approach. Performance testing ensures the system meets real-time and scalability requirements. Use Docker for consistent environments and run tests after core and integration tests are stable.

## Scope
- System response times and latency
- Throughput and data processing capacity
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Scalability and load handling
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Stress testing and failure points

## Approach
**Languages**: JavaScript/Node.js, Python, Shell
**Frameworks**: Load testing tools (e.g., Artillery, Locust), resource monitoring scripts
**Containerization**: Docker with all services
**Focus**: System performance validation and optimization

## Success Criteria
- System handles expected load within acceptable response times
- Throughput meets real-time data processing requirements
- Resource utilization stays within defined limits
- System scales appropriately with increased load
- Performance bottlenecks are identified and documented
- Stress testing reveals system limits and failure points
- Performance metrics are consistently monitored and tracked

## Implementation Strategy

### Test Structure
```

├── load-testing.test.js        # JavaScript load tests (Artillery)
├── load-testing.test.py        # Python load tests (Locust)
├── stress-testing.test.sh      # Shell stress tests
├── resource-monitoring.test.sh # Resource usage monitoring
├── throughput.test.js          # Throughput validation

```

### Core Test Components

#### 1. Load Testing (`load-testing.test.js`/`load-testing.test.py`)
- Simulate concurrent device data streams
- Measure system response times and throughput
- Validate system stability under load

#### 2. Stress Testing (`stress-testing.test.sh`)
- Push system beyond expected limits
- Identify failure points and recovery behavior

#### 3. Resource Monitoring (`resource-monitoring.test.sh`)
- Track CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
- Alert on resource exhaustion

#### 4. Throughput Testing (`throughput.test.js`)
- Validate data processing capacity
- Ensure real-time requirements are met

### Docker Integration
- Use Docker Compose to spin up all services
- Run load and stress tests from a dedicated test container
- Collect resource metrics from all containers

### Test Execution
- Sequentially run load, stress, and resource monitoring tests
- Aggregate results into a unified performance report

## Test Scenarios
- Load testing with increasing device count
- Stress testing to system failure
- Resource monitoring during peak load
- Throughput validation for real-time data
- Bottleneck identification and documentation

## MVP Considerations
- Start with basic load and resource tests
- Use realistic but manageable data volumes
- Focus on critical performance paths
- Keep performance testing scope focused and achievable
- Use Docker for consistent test environment

## Implementation Notes
- Use Artillery or Locust for load generation
- Use shell scripts for resource monitoring
- Aggregate results in a unified report
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper cleanup in test teardown
