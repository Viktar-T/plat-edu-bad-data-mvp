# Business Logic Validation (Phase 4 - Validation)

## Objective
Implement business logic and calculation validation for the renewable energy IoT monitoring system MVP, focusing on device-specific rules and renewable energy formulas.

## Context
This is Phase 4 of our incremental approach. Business logic tests ensure the correctness of domain-specific calculations and rules. Use Docker for consistent environments and run after system tests are stable.

## Scope
- Renewable energy calculations and formulas
- Device-specific business rules and algorithms
- Efficiency calculations and performance metrics
- Energy conversion and storage logic
- Fault detection and diagnostic algorithms
- Business rule validation and compliance

## Approach
**Languages**: Python, JavaScript/Node.js
**Frameworks**: Mathematical modeling, business rule engines, algorithm validation
**Containerization**: Docker with all services
**Focus**: Business logic accuracy and validation

## Success Criteria
- Renewable energy calculations are mathematically accurate
- Device-specific business rules are properly implemented
- Efficiency calculations produce correct results
- Energy conversion and storage logic works correctly
- Fault detection algorithms identify issues accurately
- Business rules comply with industry standards
- Calculations handle edge cases and boundary conditions

### Core Test Components

#### 1. Calculation Validation (`calculations.test.py`)
- Validate renewable energy calculations
- Compare against reference formulas

#### 2. Business Rules (`rules.test.js`)
- Test device-specific business rules
- Validate rule compliance

#### 3. Efficiency Testing (`efficiency.test.py`)
- Test efficiency calculations and metrics
- Validate against expected performance

#### 4. Energy Conversion (`conversion.test.js`)
- Test energy conversion and storage logic
- Validate conversion accuracy

#### 5. Fault Detection (`fault-detection.test.py`)
- Test fault detection and diagnostic algorithms
- Validate detection accuracy

### Docker Integration
- Use Docker Compose to run business logic tests in all services
- Aggregate results into a unified business logic report

### Test Execution
- Sequentially run calculation, rule, and efficiency tests
- Aggregate results into a unified business logic report

## Test Scenarios
- Validate photovoltaic and wind turbine calculations
- Test device-specific business rules
- Validate efficiency and performance metrics
- Test energy conversion and storage logic
- Validate fault detection algorithms

## MVP Considerations
- Focus on photovoltaic and wind turbine calculations first
- Test with simplified but accurate business logic
- Prioritize calculation accuracy over complex features
- Use industry-standard formulas for MVP phase
- Use Docker for consistent test environment

## Implementation Notes
- Use Python for complex calculations
- Use JavaScript for business rule validation
- Aggregate results in a unified report
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper cleanup in test teardown
