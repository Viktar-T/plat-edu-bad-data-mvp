# Manual Test 06: End-to-End Data Flow

## Overview
This test verifies the complete data flow from IoT devices through the entire monitoring system: MQTT → Node-RED → InfluxDB → Grafana.

**🔍 What This Test Does:**
This test checks if the entire IoT monitoring system works as a complete pipeline. Think of this as testing the entire production line in a factory - from raw materials (device data) to finished product (visualizations and insights). We're verifying that data flows smoothly through every component without any breaks or bottlenecks.

**🏗️ Why This Matters:**
This is the most important test because it verifies that your entire renewable energy monitoring system works end-to-end. If any part of the pipeline fails, the entire system becomes useless. This test ensures that:
- Device data is captured and transmitted
- Data is processed and validated
- Information is stored permanently
- Visualizations are created and updated
- Alerts are triggered when needed

**🔍 What This Does:**
Ensures all components of the IoT monitoring system are operational before testing the complete data flow. This is like checking that all machines in a factory are turned on before starting production.

**💡 Why This Matters:**
If any service isn't running, the entire data pipeline will fail. We need to verify that:
- MQTT broker is accepting connections
- Node-RED is processing flows
- InfluxDB is storing data
- Grafana is displaying dashboards

**Command:**
```powershell
# Check all service status
docker-compose ps

# Check service health endpoints
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:8086/health -UseBasicParsing
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:3000/api/health -UseBasicParsing
```

**📋 Understanding the Commands:**
- `docker-compose ps`: Shows status of all containers
- Health checks: Verify services are responding to requests

**Expected Result:**
- All services show "Up (healthy)" status
- Health endpoints return 200 OK
- No error messages

#### 1.2 Prepare Test Data
**🔍 What This Does:**
Creates realistic test data that simulates actual renewable energy devices. This ensures our testing represents real-world scenarios.

**💡 Why This Matters:**
Realistic test data helps us:
- **Validate Data Processing**: Ensure data transformations work correctly
- **Test Edge Cases**: Handle unusual but possible data values
- **Verify Calculations**: Check that derived values are calculated correctly
- **Test Error Handling**: Include invalid data to test error scenarios

**Action:**
1. Create test data for different device types
2. Include both valid and invalid data scenarios
3. Prepare data with realistic timestamps
4. Set up monitoring for the test

**📋 Understanding Test Data:**
**Valid Data Examples:**
```json
{
  "device_id": "panel001",
  "device_type": "photovoltaic",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "power": 1500,
    "voltage": 48.5,
    "current": 30.9,
    "temperature": 45.2
  }
}
```

**Invalid Data Examples:**
```json
{
  "device_id": "panel002",
  "device_type": "photovoltaic",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "power": -100,  // Negative power (invalid)
    "voltage": 1000, // Too high voltage (invalid)
    "current": null, // Missing current
    "temperature": "hot" // Wrong data type
  }
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Test data is prepared and ready
- Both valid and invalid scenarios are covered
- Data format matches expected schema

### Step 2: Test Complete Data Flow

#### 2.1 Send Test Data Through MQTT
**🔍 What This Does:**
Initiates the data flow by sending test messages to the MQTT broker. This simulates real devices sending their telemetry data.

**💡 Why This Matters:**
This is the starting point of our data pipeline. If this fails, nothing else will work. We need to verify that:
- MQTT broker accepts connections
- Messages are published successfully
- Topic structure is correct
- Authentication works properly

**Command:**
```powershell
# Send test data for photovoltaic devices
.\tests\scripts\test-mqtt.ps1 -PublishTest -Topic "devices/photovoltaic/panel001/telemetry" -Message '{"power": 1500, "voltage": 48.5, "current": 30.9, "temperature": 45.2}'

# Send test data for wind turbines
.\tests\scripts\test-mqtt.ps1 -PublishTest -Topic "devices/wind_turbine/turbine001/telemetry" -Message '{"power": 2000, "wind_speed": 12.5, "rpm": 1800, "temperature": 35.1}'

# Send test data for energy storage
.\tests\scripts\test-mqtt.ps1 -PublishTest -Topic "devices/energy_storage/battery001/telemetry" -Message '{"soc": 85.2, "voltage": 52.1, "current": -15.3, "temperature": 25.3}'
```

**📋 Understanding the Commands:**
- Each command sends realistic device data
- Topics follow the hierarchical structure
- Data includes all required fields
- Timestamps are automatically added

**Expected Result:**
- Messages are published successfully
- No connection errors
- No authentication failures
- Messages appear in MQTT logs

#### 2.2 Verify Node-RED Processing
**🔍 What This Does:**
Checks that Node-RED receives the MQTT messages and processes them correctly. This verifies the data transformation stage of our pipeline.

**💡 Why This Matters:**
Node-RED is the "brain" of the system that:
- **Validates Data**: Ensures data is complete and within expected ranges
- **Transforms Data**: Converts device format to database format
- **Handles Errors**: Catches and processes invalid data
- **Routes Data**: Sends data to the correct destinations

**Action in Node-RED:**
1. Open Node-RED interface at http://localhost:1880
2. Check debug panels for incoming messages
3. Verify data transformation
4. Check for any error messages

**📋 Understanding Node-RED Processing:**
**Input Data (from MQTT):**
```json
{
  "topic": "devices/photovoltaic/panel001/telemetry",
  "payload": {
    "power": 1500,
    "voltage": 48.5,
    "current": 30.9,
    "temperature": 45.2
  }
}
```

**Output Data (to InfluxDB):**
```json
{
  "measurement": "photovoltaic_data",
  "tags": {
    "device_id": "panel001",
    "device_type": "photovoltaic",
    "location": "site_a"
  },
  "fields": {
    "power": 1500,
    "voltage": 48.5,
    "current": 30.9,
    "temperature": 45.2
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Messages appear in Node-RED debug panels
- Data is properly transformed
- No processing errors
- Data flows to InfluxDB output nodes

#### 2.3 Verify InfluxDB Storage
**🔍 What This Does:**
Checks that processed data is successfully stored in InfluxDB. This verifies the data persistence stage of our pipeline.

**💡 Why This Matters:**
InfluxDB is the permanent storage for all your monitoring data. If this fails:
- Data is lost permanently
- Historical analysis becomes impossible
- Dashboards won't show data
- The entire monitoring system fails

**Command:**
```powershell
# Query recent data from InfluxDB
docker exec iot-influxdb2 influx query -o renewable_energy_org "from(bucket: \"renewable_energy_data\") |> range(start: -5m) |> filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == \"photovoltaic_data\")"
```

**📋 Understanding the Query:**
- `range(start: -5m)`: Gets data from the last 5 minutes
- `filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == \"photovoltaic_data\")`: Filters for photovoltaic data
- This should return the data we just sent through the pipeline

**Expected Result:**
- Data appears in InfluxDB queries
- All fields are present and correct
- Timestamps are accurate
- No data loss or corruption

#### 2.4 Verify Grafana Visualization
**🔍 What This Does:**
Checks that stored data appears in Grafana dashboards. This verifies the final stage of our data pipeline.

**💡 Why This Matters:**
Grafana is where users actually see and interact with the data. If this fails:
- Operators can't monitor the system
- Problems can't be detected
- Performance can't be analyzed
- The entire monitoring system becomes useless

**Action in Grafana:**
1. Open Grafana at http://localhost:3000
2. Navigate to relevant dashboards
3. Check if new data appears
4. Verify real-time updates

**📋 Understanding Grafana Visualization:**
- **Time Series Charts**: Should show the data points we just sent
- **Stat Panels**: Should display current values
- **Real-time Updates**: Data should appear within refresh interval
- **Data Accuracy**: Values should match what we sent

**Expected Result:**
- New data appears in dashboards
- Charts update in real-time
- Values are accurate and current
- No visualization errors

### Step 3: Test Data Integrity

**Action:**
1. Compare sent data with stored data
2. Check all fields are present
3. Verify data types are correct
4. Confirm timestamps are accurate

**📋 Understanding Data Integrity Checks:**
**Original Data (sent via MQTT):**
```json
{
  "power": 1500,
  "voltage": 48.5,
  "current": 30.9,
  "temperature": 45.2
}
```

**Stored Data (from InfluxDB):**
```json
{
  "_measurement": "photovoltaic_data",
  "_field": "power",
  "_value": 1500,
  "device_id": "panel001",
  "device_type": "photovoltaic",
  "_time": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Expected Result:**
- All original data is preserved
- No fields are missing or corrupted
- Data types are correct
- Timestamps are accurate
